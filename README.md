# Employee Attrition Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict employee attrition (whether an employee is likely to leave the company). The goal is to help organizations identify at-risk employees and take proactive steps to improve retention.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** dataset. It includes features such as:

- Age
- Job Role
- Monthly Income
- Job Satisfaction
- Years at Company
- Work-Life Balance
- ...and more

## 🔍 Objective

- Analyze key factors contributing to employee attrition.
- Train a classification model to predict attrition.
- Visualize the most important features influencing turnover.
- Identify high-risk employees based on prediction probability.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)

## 📈 Outputs

- Confusion Matrix for model evaluation
- Feature importance plot
- Attrition probability for each employee

## 📁 File Structure

- `employee_attrition_prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook with analysis, model training, and visualizations.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [VS Code with Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter).
3. Make sure all required libraries are installed.
